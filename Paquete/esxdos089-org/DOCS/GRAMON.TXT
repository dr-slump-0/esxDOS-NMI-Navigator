Info:
=====
Gramon is graphic monitor for finding graphic,sprites,character fonts and screens in ZX memory. It's easy version without 128kB paging support. Work with memory adress 0-65535. Gramon code is before start move to videoram to adress 16384 (length is 4096 bytes), don't need system variables. From ZX rom use only character font (#3D00-#3FFF), keyboard test (#028E-#02BE) and routines LOAD and SAVE (#4C2-#604). Gramon support the most widely used graphic modes (11 graphic modes).

Description of info line on bottom line:
----------------------------------------
MEM: 15616  = memory adress of current graphic/sprite
MODE: Z-    = type of graphic mode (Z,X,C,V,B,N), "-" show with step 1, "+" show with step 2(for sprite in format BYTE MASK,BYTE GFX,BYTE MASK,BYTE GFX...)
32 x 8      = size of current window with sprite/graphic (32=height in pixels,8=width in bytes)
BUF : 0     = buffer pointer for save up to 10 sprites

Controll keys:
--------------
RAM BROWSING:
1 = MEM-1
2 = MEM+1
5 = MEM-(8 x width)
8 = MEM+(8 x width)
6 = MEM-width
7 = MEM+width
9 = MEM-(height x width)
0 = MEM+(height x width)

DISPLAY MODES:
Z = character mode
X = sinclair mode
C = "zigzag" mode
V = columns mode
B = linear mode
N = screen mode (here is ignored -/+ mode, width=32 and height=128)

WINDOW SIZE:
O = width-1
P = width+1
Q = height-8
A = height+8
W = height-1
S = height+1

TAPE OPERATIONS:
J = load block to MEM adress (any size) - this command work only with real tape
H = save block from MEM adress with length WIDTHxHEIGHT (in mode N is fixed size 6912 bytes)
Y = save screen as "GRAMON.PIC" CODE 16384,6912

BUFFER FOR GRAPHIC/SPRITES:
K = BUF-1 (decrease number of buffer)
L = BUF+1 (increase number of buffer)
G = save sprite from window to current buffer
F = show sprite from current buffer
T = animation of sprites from buffers (show sprites from buffer 0 to current number of buffer)
O = decrease speed of animation
P = increase speed of animation
SPACE = stop animation

NEXT FUNCTIONS:
E = show/hide info line
M = swith between modes -/+ (- = step 1, + = step 2)
R = return to BASIC (show black screen - key Y=YES/N=NO)
ENTER = shift to next window/sprite
U = erase all sprites on screen and set window position to left upper row
