divideo - ESXDOS command for playing .dvo video files

1. Copy the file 'divideo' to the /bin directory of your ESXDOS drive.
2. Copy some .dvo files there too (see http://divideo.zxdemo.org/).
3. Boot up ESXDOS, and run:
	.divideo my_video.dvo

NB: The .dvo files must be fully unfragmented on disk to work correctly...
