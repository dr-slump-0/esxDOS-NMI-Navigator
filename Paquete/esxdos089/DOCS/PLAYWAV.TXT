playwav - ESXDOS command for playing .wav audio files

1. Copy the file 'playwav' to the /bin directory of your ESXDOS drive.
2. Copy some .wav files there too - they need to be 44100Hz unsigned 8-bit mono.
   If you have SoX <http://sox.sourceforge.net/> installed, you can convert
   pretty much any audio file into the appropriate format with the command line:
   sox input.wav -u -b 8 -c 1 -r 44100 --norm output.wav
3. Boot up ESXDOS, and run:
	.playwav foo.wav

NB: The .wav files must be fully unfragmented on disk to work correctly...
